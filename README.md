##### Features

Layout lets you design, save and share plays and drills.

Currently, you can:

-   Create plays by moving players and capturing key states
-   Animate plays -- step-by-step or continuously
-   Save/download and load plays
-   [Embed](#embed) plays created using layout, in any web-page!

Layout is currently in "alpha" and some of the requested/planned/hope-to-add
features are listed
[here](https://raw.github.com/huckerdom/layout/master/todo.org).

##### The name

:   (n) a plan or design of something that is laid out
 From the Ultimate glossary:
