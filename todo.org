* Ideas
  - Snap players to grid
  - Undo, redo
  - Add notes/commentary/description to each play, each frame/stage
  - Offense only mode; Offense and Defense mode; Defense only mode...
  - Add remove players
  - Standard templates
  - Show players' trail to see how players are moving
  - Add tools to measure distances or add some sort of a ruler/grid.
  - Rulers/scale to see the strategy to scale...
  - allow selecting multiple players (all offense or defense players at once, etc), and move with keyboard/mouse?
  - Allow drawing lines... which can be saved in the state.. Different line types, and line colors.
  - Share
    - atleast linkable :: dump state file to gist, read back and show
  - Handlers and cutters can be shown in different colors
  - Convert to PDF
  - Score?
* Tasks
  - Have scale factor in saved game state... or restoring fails.
  - TESTS!
  - Add disc!
  - Allow the disc path to be an IO/OI/Flat... Should probably show a
    curve between start and end points and let users select
    curvature.
