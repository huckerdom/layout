* Ideas
  - Add notes/commentary/description to each play, each frame/stage
  - Convert to PDF
  - Automatically allow saving layout to a gist (or elsewhere)
  - Add remove players
  - Add remove states
  - Move states around
  - Snap players to grid
  - Undo, redo
  - Offense only mode; Offense and Defense mode; Defense only mode...
  - Standard templates
  - Show players' trail to see how players are moving
  - Add tools to measure distances or add some sort of a ruler/grid.
  - Rulers/scale to see the strategy to scale...
  - allow selecting multiple players (all offense or defense players at once, etc), and move with keyboard/mouse?
  - Allow drawing lines... which can be saved in the state.. Different line types, and line colors.
  - Handlers and cutters can be shown in different colors
  - Score?
* Issues
  - Help is broken (Should be generated in a better way)
  - Portrait mode is broken!
    + Add tests
    + Control points are wrongly placed
    + Is state correct? I guess not.
